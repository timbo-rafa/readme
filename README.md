# Rafael's Github

Welcome to my code repository.

Repositories tagged with `demo` are demonstrations that I use on interviews if possible/requested.
`frontend` usually are zero-installation demos and you can run it live on the browser, except for native android apps, which are on Google Play, or a few non-web programs.

These live demos are on free servers (Heroku at the time of writing), in which the server may sleep if idle.
Thus, the first-time initialization may take some seconds. After this, it is much faster.
